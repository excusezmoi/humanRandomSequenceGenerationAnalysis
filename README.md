# humanRandomSequenceGenerationAnalysis

A set of programs to analyze the random sequences generated by humans

## Configuration

The configuration file for the analysis. The file is in the format of ini file, named "config.ini". The file contains the following sections:

### Files
- subjectiveFile: the file that contains the subjective similarity data

### Folders
- responseFileFolder: containing the response files, which are the txt files with responses of the subjects
- rgCalcResultsFolder: containing the output result files of the software "rgCalc"

## Data Processing

Python is used in this stage of data processing.

### main.py

Containing the essential functions to process the data. These funcitons are called by the other python files.

### MDS.py

Perform MDS analysis on the subjective similarity data. The outputs are 2D plots of the data.

### cluster.py (failed)

Perform clustering analysis on the subjective similarity data. Nothing is found in this step.

### similarityCorrelation.py

Calculate the correlation of the subjective similarity matices between two participants.

### Markov.py

**Show the markov matrix of the "number" condition** of each participant. And also the weighted markov matrix, which considers the objective distance between the numbers.

### subjectiveDistance.py

Shows
- randomDistance: the average subjective distance if the sequence is random
- averageDistance: the average actual distance from their random sequence

Both the values of "numbers" or "action" conditions can be shown. 

## Before Data Analysis..

### rgCalc

The software "rgCalc" is used to calculate the randomness of the sequences.

### readRgcalcResults.py

Read the TXT results of the software "rgCalc" and convert them to pandas dataframe. It also writes the the dataframe to CSV files.

## Data Analysis

This stage of data analysis is done in R.
